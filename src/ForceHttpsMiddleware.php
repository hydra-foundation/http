/**
 * Forces every request onto HTTPS when the app opts in.
 *
 * Two jobs, both gated on the $enabled flag (the app passes its FORCE_HTTPS
 * config value when binding this) so local http dev is untouched by default:
 *
 *   - an insecure request is answered with a 301 to the same URL on https,
 *     before any session or routing work — no point starting a session on a
 *     request we're about to redirect;
 *   - a secure request proceeds, and its response carries an HSTS header so the
 *     browser upgrades subsequent requests itself, without the round trip.
 *
 * "Secure" honours X-Forwarded-Proto: in our dev/prod stacks TLS terminates at
 * a proxy (Traefik), which forwards plain http here with the original scheme in
 * that header — trusting it is what makes the check work behind the proxy.
 *
 * It sits near the OUTERMOST of the stack (just inside the header/logging
 * decorators, outside the error handler): the upgrade should happen before the
 * app does any real work, and it must see the request before the router.
 *
 * The enabled flag is a plain bool rather than an app config object so the
 * middleware stays app-agnostic; the app binds it with its own config value.
